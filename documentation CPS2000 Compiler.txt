split into lexer, astnodes and parser
lexer: has character categories and using them, identifies the tokens of the code string provided.
astnodes contains all the astnodes and the PrintVisitor class with the respective visit node functions
parser: parses the tokens created by the lexer and creates the AST node objects with the tokens provided by the lexer.

Every Python file is constructed closely to the e-BNF provided in the assginment question.
letter, digit and hex are the character categories handled by Lexer but not by Parser. The lexer produces tokens such as identifiers, keywords, values and operators. The parser parses the tokens which are created for statements for Type (ASTTypeNode) onwards (excluding the identifier), and tokens representing characters such as the semicolon and the colon.

The list of token types is in the TokenType class of lexerassignments.py
